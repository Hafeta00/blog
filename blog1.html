        HTML is used for content and CSS is used for styles. However, Javascript is a programming language.
        When used in a browser, it's mostly used to make things interesting and add features that would otherwise require a full page reload so it allows realtime updates.
        I learned how important Javascript is when it comes to web development and making a page come "alive". I realized that html just tells where to put certain elements like text and headings. CSS is mostly used for formatting the page and adding diffrent webpage presentations.
        Javascript is also considered partly object-oriented but because of it's lack of inheritance it can be considered not fully object oriented.

        Javascript is becoming extremely popular and it has many different frameworks for implementation.The fact that functions are primitives in JavaScript should be enough of an argument that JavaScript lends itself extremely well to functional programming. There is a time and a place for prototype/object oriented programming in JavaScript, but the vast majority of problems are more efficiently solved and more easily abstracted by using independent, self-contained functions as building blocks. One of JavaScript's biggest strengths is being multi-paradigm while maintaining a small vocabulary, and a mix of procedural and functional seems to have become the standard.
